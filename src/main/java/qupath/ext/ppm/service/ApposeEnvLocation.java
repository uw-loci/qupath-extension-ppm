/**
 * Where an Appose environment is built, and what happens to the old one when
 * that changes.
 *
 * <h2>DUPLICATED ACROSS THE APPOSE EXTENSIONS -- change all five together</h2>
 *
 * The same file lives in:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code qupath-extension-cell-analysis-tools}</li>
 *   <li>{@code qupath-extension-cellAPpose}</li>
 *   <li>{@code qupath-extension-dl-pixel-classifier}</li>
 *   <li>{@code qupath-extension-fiber-analysis}</li>
 * </ul>
 * differing only in the package and the preference prefix. There is no shared
 * library yet; the intent to build one is recorded in
 * {@code claude-reports/TODO_LIST.md} ("shared Appose env-location library").
 *
 * <p>Until then this is a copy, and copies drift. The project has already paid
 * for that once: the bug reporter lives as three separate copies, and a single
 * path-scrubber defect leaked usernames from all three at the same time. This
 * code decides where multi-gigabyte installs land and, in
 * {@link #promptCleanup}, what gets deleted -- a divergence here removes the
 * wrong directory on somebody's cluster. If you change anything below, change
 * it in all five.
 *
 * <h2>Why the location is configurable</h2>
 *
 * Appose defaults to {@code ~/.local/share/appose}. On HPC and managed desktops
 * the home directory is quota-limited, and the install dies with
 * {@code Quota exceeded (os error 122)} (issue #15). Users need to redirect it
 * to scratch or project storage.
 *
 * <h2>Why cleanup is prompted, never automatic</h2>
 *
 * Changing the location does not move the old environment -- it builds a new
 * one and leaves the old behind, wasting several GB. Deleting it automatically
 * would be wrong twice over: the old environment is the only working one until
 * the new one is proven, and the directory may not be ours to remove (a shared
 * or symlinked location). So the old path is remembered, the new environment is
 * built and verified, and only then is the user ASKED, with the path and its
 * size on screen and "Keep" as the default.
